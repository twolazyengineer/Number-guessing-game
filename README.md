## Introduction

The Number-Guessing-Game is a fun and interactive game where the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess the number. The game provides feedback to help the player zero in on the correct answer.

## Features

- **User Input:** Players can input their guesses through the console.
- **Range Selection:** The range of numbers can be customized.
- **Feedback:** The game provides feedback whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Attempts Tracking:** Tracks the number of attempts made by the player to guess the correct number.
